My Experience with The Grid

Thus far, I feel The Grid isn't as user friendly as other sites. Such as Wix or Weebly. I am slightly disappointed I have to take some time to figure things out on my own. I trust the finish product will be amazing but financially contributed in hopes that it would be something I didn't have to put a lot of time in.
